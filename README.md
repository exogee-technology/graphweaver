# GraphWeaver

## Getting Started with GraphWeaver

You can create a new project with the **GraphWeaver CLI**, by running `npm init @exogee/graphweaver`.

The prompts will ask you which backends to install, and create a scaffold project with schema folders ready to create a schema.

```
❯ npm init @exogee/graphweaver
GraphWeaver

? What would your like to call your new project?
test-project

? Which GraphWeaver backends will you need?
MikroORM - PostgreSQL Backend
REST Backend

? OK, we're ready- I'm going to create a new app in /Users/helloworld/project- is that OK?
Yes

All Done!

Make sure you npm install / yarn install / pnpm install, then run the start script to get started

```

## Examples

### examples/example-basic - `@exogee/graphweaver-example-basic`

Stripped down example of using GraphWeaver with the MikroORM adapter.

```
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up .env in apps/example-basic
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
DATABASE_NAME=

# Run migration, build graphweaver packages, and run example app
cd src/apps/example-basic && pnpm start
```

### examples/example-complex - `@exogee/graphweaver-example-complex`

A more complex example of using GraphWeaver with multiple adapters and relationships in serverless.

```
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up .env in apps/example-complex
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
DATABASE_NAME=

# Run migration, build and run example app
cd src/apps/example-complex && pnpm migrate && pnpm build && pnpm start
```

### examples/databases - `@exogee/graphweaver-example-databases`

An example of using GraphWeaver with two connected databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and the MikroORM adapter.

Follow the instructions in the `./src/examples/databases/README.md` to get started.

## Contributing

### Publishing

To publish the packages in the monorepo first you need to assess the types of changes that occurred. Follow semver and run
the appropriate command for `major`, `minor` or `patch` changes.

```console
$ pnpm version:bump patch
```

Now the versions are bumped, but packages that depend on each other are still referencing the old version. Run this command
to update all the references across the monorepo.

```console
$ pnpm relink:deps
```

Now we're ready to publish. Run:

```console
$ pnpm publish:dry
```

This will show you what would be published if you went ahead and did one.

If you're happy with these and want to publish these changes, run

```console
$ pnpm publish --otp [code from 2FA device]
```

You're done!
