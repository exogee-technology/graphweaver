<!-- PROJECT TITLE -->
<h1 align="center">Graphweaver</h1>

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<p align="center">
  The code-first, MAXIMALLY CUSTOMISABLE open source alternative to Hasura that is easy to self host. 
</p>

<p align="center">
  Graphweaver speeds up your GraphQL development by securely connecting all your data sources in one place. Once your API has been bootstrapped, you can add permissions / auth and completely customise every operation in your server. We offer in-built resolvers for all common data access scenarios, but give you full flexibility to override them however you like! You also get an admin area that you can customise so that you don't have to build a back office system ever again.

<!-- WHY -->

## Why

We consistently find that everyone has lots of sources of truth. You know, CRM holding customer data, accounting systems handling invoices, and more scattered across different SaaS platforms and databases? It's a real pain to sync it all up!

In the past we used to copy data from everywhere to the DB, but that always breaks at some point.

Well, after years of grappling with this issue, we wanted a way to easily build a single GraphQL API in front of all those sources. An API that allows you to execute queries that even span across datasources (give me DB records where customer in CRM name is "Bob"), and also allows you to administer your data all from one place.

Other tools are oriented around the schema file. This is great until you actually need to go to production. Need to override that one operation? Change exactly how your auth tokens are handled? With Graphweaver you're never constrained because it's all just a standard GraphQL server which you can tweak the behaviour of however you like.

That's why we built Graphweaver. Start quickly, use the default for most things, change whatever you like, self-host, and never lose control.

## Features

- **Instant GraphQL API -** Instant CRUD API from any data source
- **Granular Permissions -** Row and column-level security
- **Multiple Data Sources -** Combine multiple data sources (Postgres, Mysql, SQLite, Saas Platforms, REST)
- **Cross Source Filters -** Graphweaver allows you to filter across data sources, from one database by another
- **100% Open Source - A**vailable on GitHub under the MIT license, so you are free to change and deploy as needed.
- **Admin Panel -** Out of the box Admin UI to view and manipulate data
- **Code First -** Maximum flexibility for you to write your own resolvers and UI
- **Code Generator -** Introspect a database and instantly create the Typescript resolvers

## Security

Graphweaver comes pre-built with the following security features:

- **Role Based Access Control -** Define permissions and access rights at a role level and assign those roles to users.
- **Access Control Lists-** Define and apply permissions based on user roles and assign them to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Row Level Security -** Implement row-level security and define who has access to which rows in the data source.
- **Column Level Security -** Fine-grained control over which fields and columns a user can access and modify.
- **Identity Providers -** Pre-built identity providers for Local Database and Amazon Cognito.

For more on security see the [security documentation](https://graphweaver.com/docs/security).

<!-- DOCUMENTATION -->

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation and usage examples can be found on our [Docs Site](https://graphweaver.com/docs). It covers installation instructions, detailed API documentation, security implementation and guides to help you get started with Graphweaver.

<!-- QUICK START -->

## Quick Start

https://github.com/exogee-technology/graphweaver/assets/81122022/3c4eb47e-84ff-476c-998f-936994e8064b

Before we start the installer make sure you are running:

- Node `>18.*`
- PNPM `>8.*`

With those two installed you can create a new project with the **Graphweaver CLI**, by running:

`npx graphweaver@latest init`

The prompts will ask you which backends to install for this app.

First you will be asked to name the project:

```
? What would your like to call your new project?
test-project
```

Next, you will be asked to choose your data source. Select your data source and press enter.

```
? Which Graphweaver backends will you need?
‚óØ MikroORM - PostgreSQL Backend
‚óØ MikroORM - MySQL Backend
‚óØ REST Backend
```

Finally, you are asked to confirm that the project is going to be created.

```
? OK, we're ready- I'm going to create a new app in "/Users/test-project" - is that OK?
Yes

All Done!

Make sure you npm install / yarn install / pnpm install, then run the start script to get started
‚ùØ
```

Once the new app has been created `cd test-project`. Then run `pnpm install` to install all the required dependencies.

Once installed, you can start the development server by running `pnpm start`.

This will launch the Graphweaver server and Admin UI at http://localhost:9000:

Very empty! We need to fill the API with data! To do that, we need to connect to a data source and create some entities.

### Next Steps

There are two options to connect a data source:

1. If you have an existing database (Postgres, MySql or Sqlite) then go to the [Importing a Database](https://graphweaver.com/docs/importing-a-database) page. This will guide you through importing your database.
1. If you have a data source but it is currently empty then go to [How to Connect a Data Source](https://graphweaver.com/docs/connect-to-a-data-source) page.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you're interested in improving Graphweaver, please refer to our Contribution Guidelines for detailed instructions.

We use [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to ensure that secrets remain secret:

- `brew install gitleaks`
- `brew install pre-commit`
- `pre-commit autoupdate`

## Publishing

Follow these steps to release new packages:

## 1. Create a new Branch:

Begin by creating a new branch. Base it on the latest main branch.

## 2. Update Package Versions:

Evaluate changes and adhere to Semantic Versioning (semver). Run the relevant command for `major`, `minor` or `patch` changes.

```console
$ pnpm version:bump patch
```

To release a beta build run:

`pnpm version:bump 1.0.0-beta.2`

## 3. Update Package References:

Now the versions are bumped, but packages that depend on each other are still referencing the old version. Run this command
to update all the references across the monorepo.

```console
$ pnpm relink:deps
```

## 4. Commit and Pull Request:

Commit the changes. Create a pull request targeting the main branch.

## 5. Review and Merge:

Await PR approval, then merge it into main to integrate new versions.

## 6. Publish to NPM:

After merging, trigger the "Publish to NPM" workflow in the Actions tab.

## 7. Verify and Monitor:

Monitor the workflow progress in GitHub Actions. Confirm successful publication in the npm registry.

You're done!
