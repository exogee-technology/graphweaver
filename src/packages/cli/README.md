<!-- WHY -->

## Why

We consistently find that everyone has lots of sources of truth. You know, CRM holding customer data, accounting systems handling invoices, and more scattered across different SaaS platforms and databases? It's a real pain to sync it all up!

In the past we used to copy data from everywhere to the DB, but that always breaks at some point.

Well, after years of grappling with this issue, we wanted a way to easily build a single GraphQL API in front of all those sources. An API that allows you to execute queries that even span across datasources (give me DB records where customer in CRM name is "Bob"), and also allows you to administer your data all from one place.

That's why we built Graphweaver. We've been using it on our projects for about a year now and think you'll love it too!

## Features

- **Instant GraphQL API -** Instant CRUD API from any data source
- **Granular Permissions -** Row and column-level security
- **Multiple Data Sources -** Combine multiple data sources (Postgres, Mysql, SQLite, Saas Platforms, REST)
- **Cross Source Filters -** Graphweaver allows you to filter across data sources, from one database by another
- **100% Open Source - A**vailable on GitHub under the MIT license, so you are free to change and deploy as needed.
- **Admin Panel -** Out of the box Admin UI to view and manipulate data
- **Code First -** Maximum flexibility for you to write your own resolvers and UI
- **Code Generator -** Introspect a database and instantly create the Typescript resolvers

## Security

Graphweaver comes pre-built with the following security features:

- **Role Based Access Control -** Define permissions and access rights at a role level and assign those roles to users.
- **Access Control Lists-** Define and apply permissions based on user roles and assign them to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Row Level Security -** Implement row-level security and define who has access to which rows in the data source.
- **Column Level Security -** Fine-grained control over which fields and columns a user can access and modify.
- **Identity Providers -** Pre-built identity providers for Local Database and Amazon Cognito.

For more on security see the [security documentation](https://graphweaver.com/docs/security).
