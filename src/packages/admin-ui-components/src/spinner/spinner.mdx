# Spinner

The Spinner component is used to indicate a loading state, showing the user that content is being processed or loaded.

## Overview

The Spinner component provides visual feedback to users when:

- Data is being fetched from an API
- A process is running in the background
- Content is being loaded or rendered
- The application is transitioning between states

It helps improve user experience by signaling that the application is working rather than frozen.

## Examples

### Large Spinner (Default)

The default large spinner provides high visibility for primary loading states.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Large} />

### Small Spinner

The small spinner is useful for inline loading indicators or when space is limited.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Small} />

### In Container

The spinner automatically centers itself within its container, making it easy to position.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.InContainer} />

### Size Comparison

A comparison of the available spinner sizes.

## Properties

<Controls of={SpinnerStories.Large} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the large spinner for primary loading states that affect a significant portion of the UI
- Use the small spinner for inline loading or when space is constrained
- The spinner is designed to be centered in its container by default
- Use the spinner to indicate background processes that take more than a moment to complete
- For buttons or other interactive elements, consider using the loading state of those components instead

## Implementation Notes

- The spinner is created using CSS animations for smooth performance
- It automatically centers itself within its parent container
- The component uses CSS variables to control its size
- The spinner animation continues indefinitely until the component is unmounted
- The spinner uses a semi-transparent white color that works well on dark backgrounds
