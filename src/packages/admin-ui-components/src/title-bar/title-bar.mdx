# Title Bar

The Title Bar component provides a consistent header area for entity list and detail pages, displaying the page title and offering relevant actions.

## Overview

The Title Bar component serves as a navigation and action header that:

- Displays the primary title and subtitle for the current page
- Provides quick access to create new entity instances
- Offers export functionality when available
- Links to the GraphQL playground for query testing
- Adapts to different screen sizes with responsive design

It's an important UI element that helps establish context and provides essential actions for each entity page.

## Examples

### Default Title Bar

The standard title bar with page title and subtitle.

<Canvas of={TitleBarStories.Default} />

### With Export Functionality

The title bar with an additional "Export to CSV" button.

<Canvas of={TitleBarStories.WithExport} />

### Long Titles

The title bar handles long titles and subtitles gracefully.

<Canvas of={TitleBarStories.LongTitles} />

### Mobile View

On smaller screens, the title bar adapts by stacking elements vertically.

<Canvas of={TitleBarStories.MobileView} />

### Read-Only Entity

For read-only entities, the "Create New" action is disabled.

<Canvas of={TitleBarStories.ReadOnlyEntity} />

## Properties

<Controls of={TitleBarStories.Default} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use consistent, concise titles that clearly identify the entity being viewed
- Keep subtitles informative but brief, providing additional context when needed
- For read-only entities, the "Create New" button is automatically disabled
- The "Export to CSV" button only appears when the `onExportToCSV` handler is provided
- The component automatically adapts to screen size to maintain usability on mobile devices

## Implementation Notes

- The Title Bar is typically positioned at the top of entity list and detail pages
- It integrates with the entity context to automatically disable actions when appropriate
- The component handles responsive design internally, adjusting layout based on screen width
- The "Open Playground" button opens the GraphQL playground in a new tab when not in an iframe
- For security reasons, when running in an iframe, the playground opens in the same window
- The component is tied to the routing system to properly navigate to entity creation screens
