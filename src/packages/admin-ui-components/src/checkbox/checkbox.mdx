# Checkbox

Checkboxes allow users to select one or more items from a set or mark an option as checked/unchecked.

## Overview

The Checkbox component is a form control that can be used to:

- Allow users to make binary choices (yes/no, true/false)
- Select multiple options from a list
- Toggle a single setting on or off
- Present a tri-state (indeterminate) selection

## Examples

### Basic Checkbox States

#### Unchecked

The default, unchecked state of the checkbox.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Unchecked} />

#### Checked

The selected state of the checkbox.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Checked} />

#### Disabled

Checkboxes can be disabled to prevent user interaction.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Disabled} />

#### Disabled and Checked

A checkbox can be both disabled and checked simultaneously.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.DisabledChecked} />

#### Indeterminate

The indeterminate state is used to represent a group where some but not all items are selected.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.Indeterminate} />

### Styling and Context

#### With Custom Label

Checkboxes can be paired with custom-styled labels.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.WithCustomLabel} />

#### Within Forms

Checkboxes are often used within forms for accepting terms or selecting options.

<Canvas of={CheckboxStories.InForm} />

## Properties

<Controls of={CheckboxStories.Unchecked} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use checkboxes when users need to select multiple items from a list
- For single on/off choices, consider using the Switch component instead
- Always provide clear, descriptive labels for checkboxes
- Group related checkboxes together
- For mutually exclusive options, use radio buttons instead
- Use the indeterminate state to indicate partially selected groups

## Accessibility

- Checkboxes are keyboard accessible and can be toggled using the Space key
- Labels should be descriptive and properly associated with the checkbox
- The component has appropriate ARIA roles for screen readers
- Disabled checkboxes are removed from the tab order
