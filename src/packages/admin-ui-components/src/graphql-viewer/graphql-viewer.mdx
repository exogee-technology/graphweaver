# GraphQlViewer

A syntax-highlighted viewer for displaying GraphQL queries, mutations, and other operations.

## Overview

The GraphQlViewer component provides syntax highlighting for GraphQL code using PrismJS. It's designed to display GraphQL queries in a readable, properly formatted way with syntax coloring.

## Examples

### Simple Query

A basic GraphQL query example:

<Canvas of={GraphQlViewerStories.SimpleQuery} />

### Query with Variables

A query that includes variables and directives:

<Canvas of={GraphQlViewerStories.QueryWithVariables} />

### Complex Query with Fragments

A more complex query that uses fragments for reusable selections:

<Canvas of={GraphQlViewerStories.ComplexQuery} />

### Mutation

An example of a GraphQL mutation operation:

<Canvas of={GraphQlViewerStories.Mutation} />

### Query with Errors

Example showing how to document potential errors in GraphQL:

<Canvas of={GraphQlViewerStories.WithErrors} />

## Properties

<Controls />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use this component whenever you need to display GraphQL queries or operations in your documentation
- The component automatically handles syntax highlighting and line numbers
- You can include comments in your GraphQL to provide additional context (using the # symbol)
- For variables or expected responses, use comments to document them

## Implementation Notes

The GraphQlViewer uses:

- `react-syntax-highlighter` with PrismJS for syntax highlighting
- The Coldark Dark theme for consistent coloring
- Line numbers to make code more readable

## Styling

The component is styled with a dark background (#14111a) to provide good contrast for the code. It includes:

- Automatic overflow handling with scrollbars
- Full height rendering
- Line numbers for reference

## Accessibility

- The syntax highlighting provides good color contrast for readability
- Code is displayed in a way that can be navigated with keyboard and screen readers
- Line numbers help users reference specific parts of the query
