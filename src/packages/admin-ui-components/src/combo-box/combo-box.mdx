# ComboBox

The ComboBox component combines input and dropdown functionality, allowing users to select from predefined options or filter through them by typing.

## Overview

The ComboBox component is a versatile form control that can be used to:

- Select a single item from a list of options
- Select multiple items from a list of options
- Search and filter through available options by typing
- Display selected item(s) with the ability to remove them

## Examples

### Single Select

Use the single select mode when users should choose only one option.

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.SingleSelect} />

### Multi Select

Use the multi select mode when users can choose multiple options.

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.MultiSelect} />

### With Pre-selected Values

ComboBoxes can have pre-selected values for both single and multi-select modes.

#### Single Pre-selected Value

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.WithSelectedValue} />

#### Multiple Pre-selected Values

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.WithMultipleSelectedValues} />

### States and Variations

#### Loading State

Display a loading spinner when options are being fetched asynchronously.

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.Loading} />

#### Disabled State

Prevent user interaction with the disabled state.

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.Disabled} />

#### Free Typing

Allow users to type to filter options.

<Canvas of={ComboBoxStories.WithFreeTyping} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use single select when only one option should be selected at a time
- Use multi select when multiple options can be selected simultaneously
- Provide clear, concise option labels that users can easily understand
- Consider adding free typing capability for long lists to allow filtering
- Use placeholder text to give users a hint about what to select
- Include a loading state for asynchronously loaded options
- For very short lists (2-5 items), consider using radio buttons or checkboxes instead

## Accessibility

- ComboBox is keyboard accessible, allowing for navigation with arrow keys
- Selected pills include keyboard delete functionality (Backspace or Delete keys)
- Focus states are visually distinct for keyboard users
- Dropdown options have visual indication for both focus and selection state
- Component includes proper ARIA roles for better screen reader support
