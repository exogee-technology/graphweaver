# DetailPanelFieldLabel

A label component for form fields in detail panels, with support for indicating required fields.

## Overview

The DetailPanelFieldLabel component provides consistent styling and behavior for field labels within detail panel forms. It displays the field name and optionally shows a required field indicator (\*) when the `required` prop is true.

## Examples

### Regular Field Label

A standard field label without the required indicator.

<Canvas of={DetailPanelFieldLabelStories.Regular} />

### Required Field Label

A field label with the required field indicator (\*).

<Canvas of={DetailPanelFieldLabelStories.Required} />

### Long Field Name

A field label with a longer text content.

<Canvas of={DetailPanelFieldLabelStories.LongFieldName} />

## Properties

<Controls />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use this component for all form field labels within detail panels
- Set the `required` prop to true for fields that must be filled
- Associate the label with its input field using the same string for both the `fieldName` prop and the input's `id` attribute
- The component automatically applies consistent styling to match the application's design system

## Accessibility

- The component properly associates labels with form controls using the HTML `for` attribute (via React's `htmlFor`)
- Required fields are marked with an asterisk (\*) that is hidden from screen readers (using `aria-hidden="true"`)
- Screen readers will still announce required fields if the associated form control has the `required` attribute
