# Toast

The Toast component provides a way to display brief, non-blocking notifications to users.

## Overview

Toasts are used throughout the application to:

- Confirm successful operations
- Alert users to errors and failures
- Indicate that operations are in progress
- Provide temporary feedback without disrupting user flow

The Toast component is built on top of the react-hot-toast library, with custom styling to match Graphweaver's design system.

## Examples

### Interactive Demo

Try out the different toast types by clicking the buttons.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Interactive} />

### Success Toast

Used to confirm that an operation has completed successfully.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Success} />

### Error Toast

Used to notify users when something has gone wrong.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.ErrorToast} />

### Loading Toast

Used to indicate that an operation is in progress.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Loading} />

### Multiple Toasts

The system can display multiple toasts simultaneously, stacking them neatly.

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Multiple} />

## Usage

```tsx
import { toast } from '@/components/toast';

// Success message
toast.success('Item created successfully');

// Error message
toast.error('Failed to save changes');

// Loading indicator
toast.loading('Uploading file...');

// Dismiss a specific toast by ID
const toastId = toast.loading('Processing...');
// Later:
toast.dismiss(toastId);

// Dismiss all toasts
toast.dismiss();
```

## Toast Types

The component supports three main types of toasts:

- **Success**: Green checkmark icon with dark background. Used for confirmations.
- **Error**: Red background with no icon. Used for error messages.
- **Loading**: Spinner animation. Used for operations in progress.

## Component Configuration

The toast component comes with the following default configuration:

- Success toasts appear for 60 seconds by default
- Error toasts appear for 100 seconds by default
- All toasts include a close button for manual dismissal
- Toasts appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Toast width is fixed at 320px for consistency

## Accessibility

- Toasts use appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
- The component preserves focus order when toasts appear and disappear
- Toast messages are concise and descriptive
- Toasts can be manually dismissed by clicking the close icon

## Implementation Notes

- The component uses react-hot-toast for rendering and managing toasts
- Custom styling is applied to match Graphweaver's design system
- The DismissibleToast component should be included once in your application layout
- Toast duration can be customized when triggered
