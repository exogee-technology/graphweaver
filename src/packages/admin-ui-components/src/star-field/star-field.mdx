# StarField

The StarField component creates an animated cosmic background with twinkling stars. It provides an engaging visual element for UI backgrounds, hero sections, or themed pages.

## Overview

The StarField component generates:

- A dark space-like background
- Randomly positioned stars of varying sizes
- Animation effects including twinkling and orbital movement
- A container that can hold other content as overlays

It's particularly useful for creating immersive experiences or branded elements within the Graphweaver application.

## Examples

### Default StarField

The basic StarField component fills its container with an animated star background.

<Canvas of={StarFieldStories.Default} />

### With Content Overlay

The StarField can contain other elements that appear above the animated background.

<Canvas of={StarFieldStories.WithContent} />

### In a Small Container

The StarField adapts to containers of any size while maintaining its cosmic appearance.

<Canvas of={StarFieldStories.SmallContainer} />

### Card Background

The StarField can serve as an engaging background for UI cards and other elements.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the StarField as a background element for themed sections of your application
- Ensure sufficient contrast for any content placed over the StarField
- Consider using the StarField for welcome screens, feature highlights, or error pages
- The component works in containers of any size, but is most effective in larger areas
- Avoid using multiple StarField components in close proximity as it may create visual noise

## Implementation Notes

- The StarField generates 100 stars with random positions and sizes
- Stars are a mix of small point-like stars and larger cross-shaped stars
- Stars have twinkle and orbital movement animations with varying durations
- The component uses CSS animations for performance
- For smaller screens, the component may be less performant due to the number of elements
- The StarField accepts all standard HTML div properties and passes them to the container

## Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure that any text content overlaid on the StarField has sufficient contrast
- The animations are subtle and shouldn't trigger vestibular disorders
- Consider providing a reduced-motion alternative for users with motion sensitivity
- When using as a background for important content, ensure the content remains legible
