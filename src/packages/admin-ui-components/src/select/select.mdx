# Select

The Select component allows users to choose one or multiple options from a dropdown list. It provides a flexible way to handle selection in both single and multi-select modes.

## Overview

The Select component is a versatile form input that can be used to:

- Select a single option from a list
- Select multiple options from a list
- Handle loading states for asynchronous data fetching
- Provide a clean UI for selection in forms

## Examples

### Single Select

The standard single-select dropdown lets users choose one option.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.SingleSelect} />

### Single Select with Preselected Value

A single-select dropdown with a pre-selected value.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.SingleWithValue} />

### Multi Select

The multi-select dropdown allows users to choose multiple options.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.MultiSelect} />

### Multi Select with Preselected Values

A multi-select dropdown with pre-selected values.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.MultiWithValues} />

### States

#### Loading State

Display a loading indicator when options are being fetched asynchronously.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Loading} />

#### Disabled State

Use the `disabled` prop to make a select unclickable.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Disabled} />

#### Empty State

How the select appears when no options are available.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.NoOptions} />

#### Required Field

Mark a select as required with the `required` prop.

<Canvas of={SelectStories.Required} />

## Properties

<Controls of={SelectStories.SingleSelect} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use single select (`SelectMode.SINGLE`) when users should choose exactly one option
- Use multi-select (`SelectMode.MULTI`) when users need to choose multiple options
- Provide clear labels to indicate what the user is selecting
- Use placeholder text to provide guidance on what to select
- Handle loading states appropriately when fetching options asynchronously
- Consider keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Include a "No options available" state for empty option lists

## Accessibility

- The Select component implements both a custom UI and a native select element for optimal accessibility
- The component is keyboard accessible and can be navigated using Tab, Enter, and arrow keys
- ARIA attributes are properly applied for screen readers
- Focus states are visually apparent with a highlight around the select
- Required fields are properly marked both visually and via HTML attributes
