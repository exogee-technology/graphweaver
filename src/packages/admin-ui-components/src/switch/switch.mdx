# Switch

The Switch component provides a toggle control for binary options, offering a more visual alternative to checkboxes.

## Overview

The Switch component is used to:

- Toggle between two states (on/off, enabled/disabled, etc.)
- Control boolean settings in forms
- Provide an intuitive visual representation of binary choices
- Allow for immediate effect actions (unlike checkboxes which often require form submission)

The component can be used both as a controlled and uncontrolled component, making it flexible for various use cases.

## Examples

### Basic Switch

The standard switch with a label.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Default} />

### Checked by Default

A switch that's in the "on" position by default.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.DefaultChecked} />

### Disabled States

Switches can be disabled to prevent user interaction.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Disabled} />

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.DisabledChecked} />

### Controlled Component

A switch whose state is managed by React state, allowing for custom logic when the state changes.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Controlled} />

### Without Label

The switch can be used without a label when the context is clear.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.NoLabel} />

### With Long Label

Labels can be of any length and will wrap as needed.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.LongLabel} />

### Multiple Options

Switches can be grouped to provide multiple related options.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.MultipleOptions} />

### In a Form

Switches work seamlessly in forms and can be used to control form state.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.InForm} />

## Properties

<Controls of={SwitchStories.Default} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use switches for binary options that can be toggled on or off
- Switches should provide immediate feedback and typically take effect immediately
- For options that require confirmation or form submission, consider using checkboxes instead
- Use clear, concise labels that describe the effect of enabling the switch
- Group related switches together for better organization
- When used in forms, switches should be properly labeled for accessibility

## Accessibility

- The component uses a native checkbox input under the hood for keyboard accessibility
- Users can toggle the switch using the Space or Enter keys when focused
- The switch includes focus styling for keyboard navigation
- Labels are associated with the input for screen readers
- Disabled states are properly conveyed to assistive technologies

## Implementation Notes

- Built using a combination of a hidden checkbox input and custom styling
- Uses CSS transitions for smooth toggle animations
- The component is implemented as a forwardRef to allow access to the underlying input element
- Can be used as both controlled and uncontrolled component
- Supports all standard HTML input attributes that apply to checkboxes
