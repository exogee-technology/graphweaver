# Button

Buttons allow users to trigger actions with a single click. They communicate calls to action and allow users to interact with the application.

## Overview

The Button component is a versatile interactive element that can be used to:

- Submit forms
- Trigger modal dialogs
- Perform application actions
- Navigate to other pages using the `href` prop

## Examples

### Default Button

The standard button with default styling.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />

### States

#### Disabled Button

Use the `disabled` prop to make a button unclickable.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

#### Loading Button

Display a loading spinner with the `loading` prop to indicate an in-progress action.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

## Properties

<Controls of={ButtonStories.Default} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use buttons for important actions that users need to easily find
- Ensure button text clearly communicates what happens when clicked
- For page navigation, use the `href` prop rather than `onClick`
- Provide visual feedback with the `loading` state for asynchronous operations
- Disable buttons when the action is unavailable
- Keep text concise; use 1-3 words when possible

## Accessibility

- Buttons are keyboard accessible and can be activated using the Enter or Space keys
- When disabled, buttons are removed from the tab order
- Loading state preserves button dimensions to prevent layout shifts
