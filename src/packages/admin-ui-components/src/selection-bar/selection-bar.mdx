# Selection Bar

The Selection Bar component displays a floating action bar when one or more table rows are selected, showing the count of selected items and providing actions that can be performed on the selected rows.

## Overview

The Selection Bar is used to:

- Display the number of currently selected rows in a table
- Provide a way to deselect all rows at once
- Present a dropdown of actions that can be performed on the selected rows (such as deletion)

It's typically used in conjunction with tables that have selectable rows, providing a non-intrusive way to manage batch operations.

## Examples

### Default

The standard Selection Bar with two selected rows.

<Canvas of={SelectionBarStories.Default} />

### Single Row Selected

The Selection Bar when only one row is selected. Notice how the text adapts to singular form.

<Canvas of={SelectionBarStories.SingleRowSelected} />

### Multiple Rows Selected

The Selection Bar with multiple rows selected, showing the count.

<Canvas of={SelectionBarStories.MultipleRowsSelected} />

## Properties

<Controls of={SelectionBarStories.Default} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Selection Bar when implementing tables with selectable rows
- The component should only be displayed when at least one row is selected
- Position it at the bottom of the viewport, so it doesn't block the table content
- Keep action options clear and concise
- Make destructive actions (like delete) visually distinct
- Always provide a way to cancel the selection

## Implementation Notes

- The Selection Bar is fixed at the bottom of the viewport
- It uses the `Popover` component for the actions dropdown
- It automatically handles singular/plural text based on selection count
- The component should be conditionally rendered based on the presence of selected rows
