# useDebounce

A hook that delays updating a value until after a specified period of inactivity.

## Overview

The `useDebounce` hook is useful for situations where you want to delay an operation until a user has stopped typing or interacting. Common use cases include search inputs, form validation, and API calls that shouldn't be triggered on every keystroke.

## API Reference

```tsx
function useDebounce<T>(value: T, setter: (value: T) => any, delay: number = 500): void;
```

### Parameters

- `value`: The value to debounce
- `setter`: A function that will be called with the debounced value
- `delay` (optional): The debounce delay in milliseconds. Default is `500ms`.

### Returns

- This hook doesn't return anything (void)

## Examples

### Basic Usage

<Canvas of={UseDebounceStories.Example} />

### Implementation Details

The hook:

1. Sets up an effect that runs whenever the input value changes
2. Creates a timeout that will call the setter function with the current value after the specified delay
3. Cleans up any pending timeouts if the value changes before the delay completes

This ensures that the setter function is only called once the user has stopped changing the value for the specified delay period.

## When to Use

- Search inputs where you want to trigger API calls only after the user stops typing
- Form validation that shouldn't run on every keystroke
- Expensive calculations that shouldn't run too frequently
- Window resize handlers that shouldn't fire too often

## Performance Considerations

- Debouncing helps reduce the number of operations performed during rapid input changes
- Choose an appropriate delay based on your use case (shorter for responsive UI updates, longer for expensive operations)
- For very performance-critical applications, consider using a memoized version of your setter function

## Comparison with Throttling

- **Debouncing** (this hook): Delays execution until after a period of inactivity
- **Throttling**: Limits execution to a maximum frequency (e.g., once every 100ms)

Choose debouncing when you want to wait until the user has "finished" an interaction before taking action.
