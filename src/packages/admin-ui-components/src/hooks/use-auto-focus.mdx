# useAutoFocus

A hook that automatically focuses an HTML element after it mounts, with a configurable delay.

## Overview

The `useAutoFocus` hook is useful for focusing form inputs, especially in modals or dynamic components. It returns a ref that should be attached to the element you want to focus.

## API Reference

```tsx
function useAutoFocus<T extends HTMLElement>(autoFocus?: boolean): React.RefObject<T>;
```

### Parameters

- `autoFocus` (optional): Boolean flag to enable/disable auto-focusing. Default is `undefined` (no focus).

### Returns

- A React ref object that should be attached to the element you want to focus.

### Configuration

The focus delay is set to `600ms` by default (from the `autoFocusDelay` configuration). This delay ensures that the element is properly rendered and visible before attempting to focus it.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

<Canvas of={UseAutoFocusStories.Example} />

### Implementation Details

The hook:

1. Creates a ref to hold the HTML element
2. Sets up an effect that:
   - Checks if auto-focus is enabled
   - Uses setTimeout to delay focusing by the configured amount
   - Focuses the element using the ref
3. Returns the ref to be attached to your element

## When to Use

- Forms where a specific field should receive focus when opened
- Modals where the first input should be focused
- Search interfaces where the search input should be automatically focused
- Any UI where you want to guide the user to a specific input

## Accessibility Considerations

Auto-focusing elements can improve user experience by reducing the need for additional clicks, but should be used thoughtfully:

- Only auto-focus when it would save the user effort
- Avoid auto-focusing in a way that might disorient users
- Consider that screen reader users may be disoriented if focus unexpectedly moves
