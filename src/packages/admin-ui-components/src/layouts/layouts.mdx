# Layout Components

The Graphweaver Admin UI layout system provides a collection of components for creating consistent, responsive layouts throughout the application.

## Overview

The layout system consists of several complementary components:

1. **Grid** - A CSS grid-based container for creating complex layouts with configurable columns and spacing
2. **Col** - A column component that can span multiple grid spaces
3. **Row** - A horizontal flex container for arranging elements in a row
4. **Page** - A standardized page layout with consistent header and content areas
5. **DefaultLayout** - The main application shell with a resizable sidebar

These components work together to create a consistent layout system across the application.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Grid Layout

The most common pattern is to use Grid with Col components:

```jsx
<Grid cols={12} gap={16}>
	<Col span={4}>Sidebar</Col>
	<Col span={8}>Main content</Col>
</Grid>
```

### Row-Based Layout

For simpler horizontal layouts, the Row component can be used:

```jsx
<Row gap={16}>
	<div>First item</div>
	<div>Second item</div>
	<div>Third item</div>
</Row>
```

### Auto-Distributing Rows

For arranging many rows into multiple columns, use Grid with the maxRowsPerColumn property:

```jsx
<Grid cols={3} maxRowsPerColumn={5} gap={16}>
	<Row>Row 1</Row>
	<Row>Row 2</Row>
	{/* Additional rows... */}
	<Row>Row 10</Row>
</Grid>
```

### Page Layout

For admin pages with standard headers:

```jsx
<Page title="Dashboard" subtitle="Overview of metrics">
	<div>Page content goes here</div>
</Page>
```

### Application Shell

The DefaultLayout is typically used at the top level of the application:

```jsx
<DefaultLayout>{/* All application content goes here */}</DefaultLayout>
```

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use the `Grid` and `Col` components for most complex layouts
- Use `Row` for simple horizontal arrangements
- Nest layout components as needed to create complex interfaces
- The layout components are designed to work together, but can also be used independently
- For consistency, all admin pages should use the `Page` component within `DefaultLayout`
