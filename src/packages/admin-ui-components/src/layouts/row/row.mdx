# Row

The Row component creates a horizontal flex layout for arranging elements in a single row.

## Overview

The Row component is designed to:

- Create a horizontal layout with elements arranged side by side
- Provide consistent spacing between rows when used in layouts
- Work together with other layout components like Grid and Col

## Examples

### Default Row

A basic row with a single child element.

<Canvas of={RowStories.Default} />

### Multiple Children

A row containing multiple child elements that are arranged horizontally.

<Canvas of={RowStories.WithMultipleChildren} />

### Custom Gap

You can customize the spacing between rows by specifying the gap property.

<Canvas of={RowStories.CustomGap} />

### With Custom CSS Class

Add a custom CSS class to extend or override the default styles.

<Canvas of={RowStories.WithCustomClassName} />

## Properties

<Controls of={RowStories.Default} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use Row components to create horizontal arrangements of elements
- When used inside a Grid with the maxRowsPerColumn property, rows will automatically distribute across columns
- Combine with Col components for more complex layouts
- For vertical stacking, consider using a column-based layout instead

## Implementation Notes

- Built on flexbox for consistent cross-browser support
- Spacing between rows is controlled via the gap property
- Custom classes can be added while preserving the core functionality
