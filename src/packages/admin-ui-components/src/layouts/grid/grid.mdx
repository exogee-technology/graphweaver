# Grid

The Grid component creates a responsive CSS grid layout for arranging content in rows and columns.

## Overview

The Grid component provides:

- A flexible grid system with customizable number of columns
- Adjustable spacing between grid items
- Automatic distribution of Row children across columns when desired
- Support for varying column widths using the Col component

## Examples

### Default Grid

A standard 12-column grid with three equally-sized columns.

<Canvas of={GridStories.Default} />

### Custom Column Count

The grid can be configured with any number of columns to create different layouts.

<Canvas of={GridStories.CustomColumns} />

### Custom Gap

Adjust the spacing between grid items by changing the gap property.

<Canvas of={GridStories.CustomGap} />

### With Rows Auto-Distribution

When maxRowsPerColumn is specified, Row children are automatically distributed across columns.

<Canvas of={GridStories.WithRows} />

## Properties

<Controls of={GridStories.Default} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use Grid as a container for organizing content in rows and columns
- Combine with Col components to create elements of varying widths
- Use the maxRowsPerColumn property with Row children to automatically distribute content across columns
- The default 12-column grid provides flexibility for most layouts, but you can customize the column count for specific needs

## Implementation Notes

- Built on CSS Grid for consistent cross-browser support
- Row children are automatically distributed based on the maxRowsPerColumn property
- The component handles both traditional grid layouts (with Col children) and row-based layouts (with Row children)
- Gaps between grid items are controlled via the gap property
