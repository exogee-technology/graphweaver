# Spacer

The Spacer component is a utility component for creating consistent spacing between elements in a flex layout.

## Overview

The Spacer component is a versatile layout utility that can be used to:

- Add fixed vertical spacing between stacked elements
- Add fixed horizontal spacing between inline elements
- Create flexible spacing that pushes elements apart
- Distribute elements evenly in a container
- Implement consistent spacing patterns throughout the application

## Examples

### Vertical Spacing

Use the Spacer with a fixed height to add vertical spacing between elements in a column layout.

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.HeightSpacer} />

### Horizontal Spacing

Use the Spacer with a fixed width to add horizontal spacing between elements in a row layout.

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.WidthSpacer} />

### Flexible Spacing with Grow

Use the Spacer with the `grow` property to push elements to the edges of a container.

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.GrowSpacer} />

### Even Distribution

Use multiple Spacers with the `flex` property to evenly distribute elements in a container.

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.FlexDistribution} />

### Fixed Dimensions

Combine width and height properties to create consistent spacing patterns.

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.FixedDimensions} />

## Properties

<Controls of={SpacerStories.HeightSpacer} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the `height` property for vertical spacing in column layouts
- Use the `width` property for horizontal spacing in row layouts
- Use the `grow` property to push elements apart (similar to `flex-grow: 1`)
- Use the `flex` property for flexible spacing that respects other flex items
- Use the `shrink` property to control how the spacer shrinks when space is limited
- Use multiple spacers for even distribution of elements

## Implementation Notes

- The Spacer is an empty `<div>` element styled with flex properties
- It can be customized with fixed dimensions or flexible spacing
- When using fixed dimensions, the component sets min/max dimensions to ensure consistent spacing
- The component accepts a custom `className` for additional styling if needed
