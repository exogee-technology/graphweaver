# Badge

Badges are small status indicators that provide quick recognition and visual context for content. They can display text, icons, or both to communicate important information at a glance.

## Overview

The Badge component is a versatile labeling element that can be used to:

- Indicate status or category
- Display counts or notifications
- Highlight important attributes
- Tag content with metadata
- Trigger actions when interactive

## Examples

### Variants

#### Primary Badge

The primary badge uses the main brand color for high-importance labels.

#### Secondary Badge

The secondary badge provides a softer appearance for medium-importance labels.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Secondary} />

#### Greyscale Badge

The greyscale badge offers a neutral appearance for low-emphasis labels.

### With Icons

#### Icon Prefix

Add an icon before the text to provide additional visual context.

#### Icon Suffix

Add an icon after the text for supplementary information.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithIconSuffix} />

#### Both Icons

Combine prefix and suffix icons for maximum visual impact.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use badges to provide quick visual context without cluttering the interface
- Choose variants based on importance: primary for critical info, secondary for moderate importance, greyscale for neutral labels
- Keep text concise; badges work best with 1-2 words
- Use icons to enhance meaning but ensure they're universally understood
- Make badges interactive only when they serve a clear purpose (filtering, navigation, etc.)
- Maintain consistent badge usage throughout your application

## Accessibility

- Interactive badges are keyboard accessible and can be activated using the Enter or Space keys
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all badge variants
- When using icons, consider adding aria-labels for screen readers
- Avoid relying solely on color to communicate information
- Keep badge text descriptive and meaningful for assistive technologies
