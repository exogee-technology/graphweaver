# Toolbar

The Toolbar component combines a title area with filtering capabilities to provide a consistent header for entity list pages.

## Overview

The Toolbar component serves as a composite header that:

- Displays the entity title and subtitle
- Provides action buttons for entity creation and other operations
- Offers filtering capabilities for the data below
- Adapts to different screen sizes with responsive design

It's designed to be used at the top of entity listing pages, providing both context and interaction capabilities.

## Examples

### Default Toolbar

The standard toolbar with title, subtitle, and filters.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Default} />

### With Export Functionality

The toolbar with an additional "Export to CSV" button.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.WithExport} />

### Without Filters

The toolbar can be used without the filter bar for pages that don't require filtering.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.WithoutFilters} />

### Long Titles

The toolbar handles long titles and subtitles gracefully.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.LongTitles} />

### Mobile View

On smaller screens, the toolbar adapts by stacking elements vertically.

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.MobileView} />

## Properties

<Controls of={ToolbarStories.Default} />

## Composition

The Toolbar is a composite component that combines:

1. **TitleBar** - Displays the entity title, subtitle, and action buttons
2. **FilterBar** - Provides filtering capabilities based on entity fields

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the Toolbar at the top of entity list pages
- Provide clear, concise titles that identify the entity being viewed
- Use the subtitle to give additional context about the data
- The "Export to CSV" button should only be shown when export functionality is available
- The filter bar automatically adapts to show filters relevant to the entity's fields

## Implementation Notes

- The Toolbar memoizes the FilterBar to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- The component automatically integrates with the entity context to show relevant filters
- Filters are applied as URL parameters for shareable filtering
- The component integrates with the routing system to handle filter navigation
- On mobile devices, the layout adjusts to stack elements vertically
