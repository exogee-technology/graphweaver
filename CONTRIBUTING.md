## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you encounter a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/exogee-technology/graphweaver/issues) with the relevant information. Be sure to include steps to reproduce the bug or a clear description of the proposed feature.

## Code Style

Please follow the project's coding style and conventions when submitting code changes. If you are unsure about any aspect of the coding guidelines, feel free to ask in your pull request or as a comment in the related issue.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that all existing tests pass and add new tests where relevant to cover your changes within the end to end test package. Make sure to run the test suite locally to confirm that everything works as expected.

## Use of packages containing native modules

We are working to keep Graphweaver free of dependencies that contain native modules. This increases deployment complexity as native code cannot be bundled, which increases complexity in the deployment process. We have included a standalone test (in the `end-to-end` test project) as well as a check in Github Actions to help detect if native modules have made their way into Graphweaver project dependencies. Note this restriction only applies to production dependencies - dev dependencies are allowed to contain native modules as they are not included in production builds.

## Documentation

Improvements to the project's documentation are always welcome. If you find any parts of the documentation that are unclear or incomplete, please feel free to report the issue and we can work to update it.
